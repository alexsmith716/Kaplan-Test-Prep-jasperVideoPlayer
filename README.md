# Jasper Video Player

### Overview:
<p>Flash-based, rtmp streaming video player I built. This player was used by our Flash platforms.</p>

<p>Like all our projects, the entire Flash application, including code and graphics, were created entirely by us (scroll-bars, timers, progress-bars, video-players, widgets, etc.). The only Adobe components we used were the XML connectors. Our graphics were guided by designs provided to us by the design team.</p>

<p>I can assure you, if looking through the code, I have learned the importance of asynchronous code design vs synchronous!</p>
